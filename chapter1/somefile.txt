Read BeginnersGuide/Overview for a short explanation of what Python is.

Getting Python

Next, install the Python interpreter on your computer. This is the program that reads Python programs and carries out their instructions; you need it before you can do any Python programming. Mac OSX distributions from 10.3 (Panther) and up include a version of Python, which may be suitable for beginning despite being as much as two years out of date. Linux distributions also frequently include Python, which is readily upgraded.

There are also Python interpreter and IDE bundles available, such as Thonny. Other options can be found at IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironments.

There are currently two major versions of Python available: Python 2 and Python 3. The Python2orPython3 page provides advice on how to decide which one will best suit your needs.

See BeginnersGuide/Download for instructions to download the correct version of Python.

At some stage, you'll want to edit and save your program code. Take a look at HowToEditPythonCode for some advice and recommendations.

Learning Python

Next, read a tutorial and try some simple experiments with your new Python interpreter.

If you have never programmed before, see BeginnersGuide/NonProgrammers for a list of suitable tutorials.
If you have previous programming experience, consult BeginnersGuide/Programmers, which lists more advanced tutorials.
If English isn't your first language, you might be more comfortable with a tutorial that's been translated into your language. Consult python.org's list of Non-English resources.
Most tutorials assume that you know how to run a program on your computer. If you are using Windows and need help with this, see How do I Run a Program Under Windows. There are also sites that offer in-browser coding for those who want to learn Python: see Codecademy for general python and DataCamp or Dataquest for Python for data science.
